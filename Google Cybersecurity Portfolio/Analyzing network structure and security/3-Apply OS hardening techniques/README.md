**Project Description:**

As a cybersecurity analyst at yummyrecipesforme.com, I was faced with a critical incident involving a disgruntled individual executing a brute force attack on our website. This project provides a comprehensive overview of the incident, detailing the attack vector, impact, and recommendations for preventing similar attacks in the future. It showcases my expertise in incident response and proactive security measures.

**Project Scope:**

The project involved the following key activities:

**Incident Detection:** The project commenced with the detection of an incident triggered by multiple customer complaints. Users reported being prompted to download a file to update their browsers, resulting in unexpected website behavior and decreased computer performance.

**Incident Investigation:** I initiated an investigation into the incident, given the severity of the customer complaints and the suspicion of a cyberattack.

**Sandbox Environment:** To observe and analyze the suspicious website behavior safely, I created a sandbox environment. Within this controlled environment, I ran a network protocol analyzer, tcpdump, and accessed the website, which led to the download of the suspicious file.

**Attack Analysis:** In-depth analysis of the incident logs revealed a series of events:

```
DNS resolution for yummyrecipesforme.com
Correct IP address retrieval from DNS
HTTP request initiation
Malware download
DNS resolution for greatrecipesforme.com
Browser redirection to a new IP address (greatrecipesforme.com)
```

**Source Code Examination:** Subsequent investigation by a senior analyst unveiled unauthorized javascript code embedded within the website's source code, prompting visitors to download an executable file. The downloaded script redirected users to a counterfeit website, where previously paid recipes were made available for free.

**Attack Attribution:** It was determined that the incident stemmed from a brute force attack on the website's admin panel. The attacker gained access by repeatedly attempting known default passwords until the correct one was guessed.

**Lack of Preventive Controls:** The cybersecurity team identified critical shortcomings, including the use of a default password and the absence of controls to thwart brute force attacks.

**Incident Documentation:** I compiled a comprehensive incident report, detailing the attack vector, the impact on website visitors and their systems, and the precise sequence of events leading to the compromise.

**Recommendations:** The report included recommendations for preventing future brute force attacks, emphasizing the importance of robust password policies, account lockouts, and monitoring mechanisms.

**Project Impact:**

This project made a substantial impact on the organization's cybersecurity posture:

**Enhanced Incident Response:** The swift and methodical response to the incident demonstrated our ability to identify, contain, and investigate cybersecurity threats effectively.

**Improved Website Security:** Recommendations provided a roadmap for implementing security controls, thereby reducing the risk of future brute force attacks.

**User Trust Restoration:** Proactive measures helped restore user trust by securing the website and protecting customer data.

**Demonstrated Expertise:** This project showcased my skills in incident analysis, threat mitigation, and proactive security strategy development.

In my GitHub portfolio, you will find the detailed incident report and recommendations, illustrating my commitment to cybersecurity best practices and ensuring the safety of digital assets.
