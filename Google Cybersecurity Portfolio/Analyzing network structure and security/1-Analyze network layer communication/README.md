**Project Description:**

As a cybersecurity analyst at a prominent IT consultancy firm, I was tasked with investigating and analyzing a critical incident reported by multiple customers. They were experiencing difficulties accessing the company website, www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and were encountering the error message "destination port unreachable." This project involved conducting a meticulous network protocol analysis to identify the affected network protocol and service, providing valuable insights into network troubleshooting and incident response.

**Project Scope:**

The project encompassed the following key activities:

**Incident Analysis:** I initiated the project by replicating the reported issue, visiting the website myself, and encountering the "destination port unreachable" error.

**Network Packet Capture:** To gain a deeper understanding of the issue, I utilized the network analyzer tool, tcpdump, to capture network packets while attempting to access the website again.

**Log Examination:** I meticulously examined the DNS and ICMP log generated by tcpdump, which provided crucial details about the incident.

**Data Interpretation:** The log revealed timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, protocol information, and port numbers associated with the incident. Specifically, it indicated that UDP packets sent to port 53 were returning ICMP responses with the error message "udp port 53 unreachable."

**Protocol and Port Identification:** I deciphered the log data to conclude that the affected network protocol was UDP, and the impacted service was DNS, as indicated by the communication over port 53.

**Report Generation:** A comprehensive follow-up report was created to document the incident analysis findings, including the identified network protocol and service. This report would serve as a valuable resource for incident resolution.

**Project Impact:**

This project had a notable impact on incident response and network troubleshooting within the organization:

**Swift Incident Identification:** By promptly identifying the affected network protocol and service, the incident response team could focus their efforts on resolving the issue efficiently.

**Enhanced Incident Documentation:** The detailed report provided clear insights into the incident, aiding in communication with other stakeholders and incident resolution.

**Improved Incident Resolution:** Armed with the knowledge of the affected DNS service, security engineers could take appropriate measures to restore normal service and prevent future occurrences.

**Contributed to Incident Management Skills:** This project showcased my ability to analyze network traffic and identify the root cause of network-related issues, a critical skill for cybersecurity analysts.

In my GitHub portfolio, you will find the comprehensive report detailing the incident analysis, network protocol identification, and recommendations for resolution. This project exemplifies my dedication to solving complex network-related incidents and my commitment to enhancing network security in real-world scenarios.
