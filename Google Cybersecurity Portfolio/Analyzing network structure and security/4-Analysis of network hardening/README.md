**Project Description:**

In this cybersecurity project, I undertook the role of a security analyst within a social media organization that recently suffered a significant data breach, compromising the personal information of its users, including names and addresses. The primary objective of this project was to establish robust network hardening practices to safeguard the organization's network infrastructure effectively, thereby preventing potential future breaches and cyberattacks.

**Project Objectives:**

**Identify Vulnerabilities:** The initial step involved conducting a comprehensive assessment of the organization's network infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities that contributed to the recent data breach. Four critical vulnerabilities were identified:

a. **Password Sharing:** Employees within the organization were sharing passwords, posing a significant security risk.

b. **Default Database Password:** The admin password for the database remained at its default setting, which was a glaring security weakness.

c. **Lack of Firewall Rules:** Firewalls within the network lacked necessary rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, making the network vulnerable to unauthorized access.

d. **Absence of Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** The organization did not have MFA implemented, leaving user accounts susceptible to credential-based attacks.

**Security Risk Assessment:** A comprehensive security risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of these vulnerabilities. The assessment included the likelihood of exploitation, the impact on the organization, and the overall risk rating for each vulnerability.

**Security Mitigation Strategies:** To address these vulnerabilities, I proposed a set of robust security measures and best practices:

a. **Password Management Policy:** The organization needed to implement a stringent password management policy that discouraged password sharing and encouraged regular password updates.

b. **Database Password Reset:** Changing the default admin database password to a strong, unique, and regularly rotated one was crucial.

c. **Firewall Rule Implementation:** Configuring firewalls with strict rules to filter traffic, restrict unauthorized access, and only permit necessary communication was necessary.

d. **MFA Implementation:** Introducing MFA for user accounts was proposed as a crucial step in enhancing account security.

**Documentation and Reporting:** Detailed documentation and a comprehensive report were prepared to communicate the identified vulnerabilities, risk assessments, and recommended security measures to the organization's management. This documentation served as a foundation for decision-making and future implementation.

**Implementation and Testing:** Following the approval of proposed security measures, the project involved assisting the organization in implementing and testing these measures to ensure they were effectively protecting the network infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**

This project represents a crucial step toward enhancing the security posture of the social media organization, reducing vulnerabilities, and mitigating potential risks associated with data breaches and cyberattacks. It highlights the importance of proactive security measures and continuous monitoring to safeguard sensitive user information and maintain user trust in the digital age.

As a security analyst, this project showcases my ability to identify vulnerabilities, conduct risk assessments, and propose effective security solutions to address critical security issues within an organization's network infrastructure. It underscores my commitment to promoting cybersecurity best practices and protecting sensitive data from potential threats.

By adding this project to my cybersecurity portfolio on GitHub, I aim to demonstrate my practical experience and dedication to ensuring the security and integrity of digital systems, contributing to a safer and more secure cyber landscape.
