**Project Description:**

This project focuses on my role as a cybersecurity analyst within a multimedia company providing web design, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. The company recently experienced a disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised the internal network for a significant duration. This project aims to create a comprehensive cybersecurity plan following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to improve the company's network security.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Identify Security Risks:** The project commenced with conducting regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges. This step aimed to identify potential security gaps and vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the DDoS attack.

2. **Protection Measures:** Implement robust policies, procedures, training programs, and security tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats. In this case, the primary focus was on enhancing network security to prevent future DDoS attacks.

3. **Detection Enhancements:** Enhance network monitoring capabilities to rapidly detect and respond to potential security incidents, including DDoS attacks. This involved implementing advanced network monitoring software.

4. **Response Strategy:** Develop an incident response plan to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, specifically addressing DDoS attacks. This also included implementing additional security measures to prevent future DDoS attacks.

5. **Recovery Plan:** Establish a plan for the recovery of affected systems, ensuring a swift return to normal operation while restoring systems data and assets that may have been impacted during the incident.

**Project Steps:**

- **Incident Investigation:** The project began with an in-depth investigation into the recent DDoS attack. This involved analyzing the attack vector, its impact, and the specific vulnerabilities that allowed the attacker to overwhelm the network.

- **Security Improvements:** Based on the NIST CSF framework, the project focused on making specific improvements to the organization's security posture. This included:
  - Implementing a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets, mitigating similar attacks.
  - Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses, preventing attacks with falsified source information.
  - Deployment of network monitoring software to detect and analyze abnormal traffic patterns, providing early warnings of potential attacks.
  - Integration of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to filter out suspicious ICMP traffic, enhancing security against future DDoS attacks.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation was prepared at each stage of the project, including the identification of vulnerabilities, the implementation of security measures, and the incident response and recovery plans.

- **Cybersecurity Plan Integration:** The findings and recommendations from this project were integrated into a broader cybersecurity plan, aligning with the NIST CSF framework.

**Conclusion:**

This project showcases my ability as a cybersecurity analyst to effectively analyze security incidents, identify vulnerabilities, and implement measures to enhance network security following industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. It underscores my commitment to strengthening an organization's defenses against cyber threats and ensuring business continuity.

By adding this project to my cybersecurity portfolio on GitHub, I aim to demonstrate my practical experience in safeguarding networks against DDoS attacks and my dedication to implementing robust security measures that protect critical digital assets, contributing to a safer and more resilient digital environment.
